# New Hotkeys

This mod was originally created by "modding" and it can be found in this [Klei Entertainment Forum](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/64875-mod-additional-hotkeys-for-dont-starve)
Since the topic is closed I decided to download and do some changes

The mod will try to find in our inventory the current item and:

* If the item wasn't found, it'll be created and equiped;
* If the item is already equiped a reserve item will be created.

### For Buildings

The building will be created at the current position of the character, without accompanying mouse ponit-and-click interaction
